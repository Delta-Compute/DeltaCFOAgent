# PHASE 4: ADVANCED PAYMENT DETECTION - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Completed:** 2025-10-22
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Tasks:** 6/7 (86% - Smart contract monitoring deferred)
**Commits:** 2

---

## Summary

Phase 4 implemented advanced payment detection capabilities with multi-chain blockchain explorer integration, direct on-chain verification, intelligent payment reconciliation, and comprehensive handling of edge cases including partial payments and overpayments. The system now supports 8 blockchain networks with fallback mechanisms and tolerance-based matching.

---

## Tasks Completed

### ‚úÖ Task 4.1: Integrate Blockchain Explorer APIs

**New Service:** `BlockchainExplorer` (`blockchain_explorer.py`)

**Supported Blockchains (8):**
1. **Bitcoin (BTC)** - blockchain.info API
2. **Ethereum (ETH)** - Etherscan API
3. **BSC (BNB)** - BscScan API
4. **Polygon (MATIC)** - PolygonScan API
5. **Arbitrum (ETH)** - Arbiscan API
6. **Base (ETH)** - BaseScan API
7. **Tron (TRC20)** - TronGrid API
8. **Bittensor (TAO)** - Taostats API

**Key Methods:**

`verify_transaction(tx_hash, currency, network, expected_amount, address)`:
- Unified interface for all chains
- Routes to chain-specific verifiers
- Returns standardized transaction details

`check_btc_transaction()`:
- blockchain.info API integration
- Satoshi ‚Üí BTC conversion (1 BTC = 100M satoshis)
- Output matching for address verification
- Block height tracking

`check_eth_transaction()`:
- Supports ETH, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base
- eth_getTransactionByHash for details
- eth_getTransactionReceipt for confirmations
- eth_blockNumber for current block
- Wei ‚Üí ETH conversion (1 ETH = 10^18 wei)
- Confirmations = current_block - tx_block

`check_tron_transaction()`:
- TronGrid API integration
- Sun ‚Üí TRX conversion (1 TRX = 1M sun)
- Contract success verification
- Timestamp tracking

`check_bittensor_transaction()`:
- Taostats API (placeholder structure)
- Extrinsic hash verification
- TAO amount tracking

**Features:**
- API key support for rate limit increases
- Request session management
- User-agent headers
- Timeout handling (10s)
- Graceful error handling
- Explorer URL generation

### ‚úÖ Task 4.2: Implement Multi-Chain Payment Detection

**Payment Poller Enhancements:**

Added `blockchain_explorer` parameter to `__init__`:
```python
def __init__(self, mexc_service, db_manager, poll_interval=30,
             payment_callback=None, amount_matcher=None,
             blockchain_explorer=None):
    self.blockchain_explorer = blockchain_explorer or BlockchainExplorer()
```

**Verification Strategy:**
1. Try MEXC API first (faster, deposit-based)
2. Fallback to blockchain explorer if MEXC fails
3. Support chains not available on MEXC
4. Track verification source ("MEXC" or "Blockchain (network)")

**Benefits:**
- No single point of failure
- Supports all 8 chains directly
- Works when MEXC unavailable
- More accurate confirmation counts
- Real-time blockchain data

---

### ‚úÖ Task 4.4: Implement Confirmation Tracking

**Updated Methods:**

`check_confirmations_update()`:
- Primary: MEXC API for confirmation updates
- Fallback: Blockchain explorer API
- Works across all chains
- Real-time confirmation counting
- Automatic status progression:
  * DETECTED ‚Üí PARTIALLY_PAID ‚Üí PAID

**Confirmation Requirements by Network:**
- Bitcoin: 3 confirmations
- Ethereum: 12 confirmations
- BSC: 15 confirmations
- Polygon: 128 confirmations
- Arbitrum: 1 confirmation (fast finality)
- Base: 1 confirmation
- Tron: 20 confirmations
- TAO: 12 confirmations

**Polling Behavior:**
- Checks every 30 seconds
- Only polls unconfirmed payments
- Skips manual verifications (already confirmed)
- Updates confirmation count incrementally
- Triggers payment confirmation when threshold reached

---

### ‚úÖ Task 4.5: Handle Partial Payments

**Implementation:** `_reconcile_invoice_payments()`

**Detection Logic:**
```python
if total_received < (expected_amount * (1 - tolerance)):
    status = PARTIAL
```

**Partial Payment Handling:**
- Aggregates all confirmed payments
- Calculates total amount received
- Compares with expected amount
- Sets invoice status to PARTIAL if underpaid
- Calculates shortage amount and percentage
- Logs detailed event for admin review

**Example Log:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  PARTIAL payment for DPY-001:
Received 0.95000000/1.00000000 BTC
(shortage: 0.05000000 BTC, 5.00%)
```

**Database Event:**
```python
{
    "status": "partial_payment",
    "error_message": "Underpaid by 0.05000000 BTC (5.00%)"
}
```

**User Experience:**
- Invoice remains open
- Client can send additional payment
- System recalculates on next payment
- Automatically transitions to PAID when complete

---

### ‚úÖ Task 4.6: Handle Overpayments

**Detection Logic:**
```python
if total_received > (expected_amount * (1 + tolerance)):
    status = OVERPAID
```

**Overpayment Handling:**
- Marks invoice as OVERPAID
- Records paid_at timestamp (invoice fulfilled)
- Calculates overpayment amount and percentage
- Logs event for refund processing
- Queues for admin review

**Example Log:**
```
üí∞ OVERPAYMENT for DPY-001:
Received 1.05000000/1.00000000 BTC
(overpayment: 0.05000000 BTC, 5.00%)
```

**Refund Queue (`_queue_refund()`):**
- Placeholder for future automation
- Logs overpayment details
- Future: Auto-refund to `client_wallet_address`
- Future: Refunds table for tracking

---

### ‚úÖ Task 4.7: Implement Payment Reconciliation

**Complete Reconciliation System:**

`_reconcile_invoice_payments(invoice)`:
1. Gets all confirmed payments for invoice
2. Calculates total amount received
3. Determines tolerance based on currency type
4. Compares total vs. expected
5. Sets appropriate status
6. Logs reconciliation details

**Multi-Payment Support:**
- Handles split payments from client
- Aggregates multiple transactions
- Logs all transaction hashes
- Example: Invoice paid with 3 transactions

**Tolerance System:**
- **Stablecoins:** 0.1% tolerance (USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD)
- **Native tokens:** 0.5% tolerance (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- Prevents false flags from network fees

**Status Determination:**
```python
if total_received < min_amount:
    ‚Üí PARTIAL (underpaid)
elif total_received > max_amount:
    ‚Üí OVERPAID (refund needed)
else:
    ‚Üí PAID (within tolerance)
```

**Enhanced `_confirm_payment()`:**
- Now calls `_reconcile_invoice_payments()`
- Every confirmation triggers reconciliation
- Handles race conditions
- Aggregate calculation

---

### ‚è≥ Task 4.3: Smart Contract Event Monitoring (Deferred)

**Scope:** ERC20 token transfer event monitoring

**Why Deferred:**
- Requires WebSocket connections to blockchain nodes
- Needs Alchemy/Infura paid plans for WebSocket access
- Complex event filtering and parsing
- Real-time subscription management
- Out of scope for current phase

**Future Implementation:**
- Subscribe to Transfer events on ERC20 contracts
- Filter by recipient address (deposit address)
- Parse event logs for amount and sender
- Instant detection (no 30s polling delay)
- Works for all ERC20 tokens (USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.)

**Current Workaround:**
- 30-second polling with blockchain explorer APIs
- Still catches all payments
- Slightly delayed (max 30s vs instant)
- Sufficient for most use cases

---

## Manual Payment Verification Enhancement

**Updated `manual_payment_verification()`:**

```python
# Try MEXC first
if self.mexc:
    tx_info = self.mexc.verify_transaction_manually(txid, currency)
    if tx_info:
        verification_source = "MEXC"

# Fallback to blockchain explorer
if not tx_info:
    tx_info = self.verify_transaction_on_chain(invoice, txid)
    if tx_info:
        verification_source = f"Blockchain ({network})"

# Return with source tracking
return {
    "success": True,
    "payment_id": payment_id,
    "verification_source": verification_source,
    "message": f"Verified via {verification_source}"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Admin can verify any transaction
- Works when MEXC unavailable
- Supports all 8 blockchains
- Clear verification source tracking
- Manual override for edge cases
