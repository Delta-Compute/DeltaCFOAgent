# Incremental Testing Roadmap - DeltaCFOAgent

## Philosophy: Start Small, Build Gradually

Instead of building a massive test suite all at once, we'll add tests incrementally in **small, digestible chunks**. Each phase can be completed in 2-4 hours and immediately integrated into CI/CD.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 0: Minimal Viable Test Suite (START HERE - Today)

**Goal:** Get basic testing infrastructure working with minimal tests
**Time:** 2-4 hours
**Coverage Target:** ~10-15% (just critical paths)

### What We'll Build:
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py                    # Basic fixtures
â”œâ”€â”€ test_database_basic.py         # 5 database tests
â””â”€â”€ test_api_health.py             # 3 API health tests
```

### Tests Included (8 total):
1. **Database Connection Test** - Can we connect to PostgreSQL?
2. **Database Query Test** - Can we execute basic SELECT?
3. **Database Insert Test** - Can we insert a test record?
4. **Database Transaction Test** - Do transactions work?
5. **Database Pool Test** - Is connection pooling working?
6. **API Health Endpoint** - Does /health return 200?
7. **API Database Check** - Does /health check database?
8. **API Basic Response** - Does API return valid JSON?

### Dependencies (Minimal):
```txt
pytest>=7.4.0
pytest-cov>=4.1.0
pytest-flask>=1.2.0
responses>=0.23.0
```

### CI/CD Setup:
- Basic GitHub Actions workflow
- Run on push to any branch
- No coverage enforcement yet (just pass/fail)

### Success Criteria:
âœ… Tests run locally with `pytest`
âœ… Tests run in GitHub Actions
âœ… Takes <30 seconds to run
âœ… Team understands how to run tests

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Roadmap

### For Each Phase:

1. **Pick the next phase** from the schedule
2. **Create the test file** listed in that phase
3. **Write the tests** (usually 5-15 tests per phase)
4. **Run locally:** `pytest tests/test_new_file.py`
5. **Commit & push** - CI/CD runs automatically
6. **Verify CI passes** on GitHub
7. **Move to next phase**

### Rules:

- âœ… **Each phase is independent** - can be done by different team members
- âœ… **Each phase takes 2-4 hours** - doable in one sitting
- âœ… **Commit after each phase** - incremental progress
- âœ… **CI/CD runs after each commit** - immediate feedback
- âœ… **Coverage increases gradually** - no pressure to hit 80% immediately

### Flexibility:

- **Skip phases** if modules aren't critical for your use case
- **Reorder phases** based on current development priorities
- **Add custom phases** for your specific features
- **Take breaks** between phases - no rush

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Improvement

After completing the roadmap:

- **Add tests when bugs are found** - write regression test first
- **Add tests for new features** - require tests in PR reviews
- **Refactor old tests** - keep test suite maintainable
- **Monitor test execution time** - keep under 2 minutes
- **Update fixtures** - keep test data realistic

---

- Demo Phase 0 tests to team
- Show how to run `pytest` locally
- Explain CI/CD feedback

### Week 2: Pair Programming
- Pair with team members on Phase 3-4
